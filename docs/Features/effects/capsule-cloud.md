**Styles:** the **Style** menu in the effect card switches to another look of the same engine and keeps the values and keyframes: [Data Hatching](./data-hatch.md), [Dither Text](./dither-text.md), [Glyph Matrix](./glyph-matrix.md), [Matrix Rain](./matrix.md), [Dither Glow](./pixel-dither.md), [Symbol Matrix](./symbol-matrix.md), [Creative UI Collage](./ui-collage.md).

## Technical details

Tag Pills is one look of the glyph engine; its looks share one node setup. It changes over time: its picture depends on the playback time or on earlier frames. How effects are stored, rendered and exported: [Effect system](../Effect-System.md). Its building blocks: [Node Catalog](../Node-Catalog.md).

**Styles:** the **Style** menu in the effect card switches to another look of the same engine. Controls you changed keep their values and keyframes when the new look has the same control, also under another name; the others start at the new look's defaults. Looks of Text & Glyph: [ASCII](./ascii.md), [Brand Generator](./brand-generator.md), [Contour Type](./contour-type.md), [Creative UI Collage](./ui-collage.md), [Data Hatching](./data-hatch.md), [Dither Glow](./pixel-dither.md), [Dither Text](./dither-text.md), [Glyph Matrix](./glyph-matrix.md), [Grid Glyph](./grid-glyph.md), [Inscribe](./inscribe.md), [Matrix Rain](./matrix.md), [Number Field](./number-field.md), [Pixel Code](./pixel-code.md), [Symbol Matrix](./symbol-matrix.md), [Tag Pills](./capsule-cloud.md), [Word Mosaic](./word-mosaic.md).

## Technical details

Retro Matrix is one look of the glyph engine; its looks share one node setup. It keeps moving while the playhead stands still. How effects are stored, rendered and exported: [Effect system](../Effect-System.md). Its building blocks: [Node Catalog](../Node-Catalog.md).

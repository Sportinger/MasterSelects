## Slot Grid (Multi-Layer Composition)

Resolume-style slot grid for simultaneous multi-layer composition playback. The grid overlays the Timeline panel and allows triggering multiple compositions on independent layers, each running on its own wall-clock time.

### Grid Layout

The slot grid is a 4-row by 12-column grid:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Row labels** | Letters A through D on the left edge, each representing one playback layer |
| **Column headers** | Numbers 1 through 12 along the top, clickable to activate an entire column |
| **Slots** | 100px cells displaying a mini-timeline preview of the assigned composition |
| **Corner cell** | Empty top-left corner where row labels and column headers meet |

Compositions are automatically assigned to slots in order, or can be dragged to any position. Each slot shows:
- A mini-timeline preview with track/clip layout
- The composition name
- A live playhead indicator (red line) when the composition is active
- A "PRV" preview strip button for previewing without activating

### Opening the Slot Grid

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Down` | Zoom out from Timeline into Slot Grid view |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Up` | Zoom back into Timeline (only when hovering a filled slot) |

The transition between Timeline and Slot Grid uses a 250ms ease-out cubic animation. During transition, the Timeline scales back slightly and fades out while the grid fades in.

### Slot Interaction

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Click a filled slot** | Activate the composition on that slot's layer (A-D) and start playback from the beginning |
| **Re-click an active slot** | Restart playback from the beginning |
| **Click an empty slot** | Deactivate that layer entirely |
| **Click a column header** | Activate all compositions in that column simultaneously across all layers |
| **Drag a slot** | Reorder/move a composition to a different slot position (swap if target is occupied) |
| **Click "PRV" strip** | Toggle preview mode for that composition without activating it on a layer |

### Multi-Layer Playback

Each layer (A through D) can have one active composition playing at the same time. All active layers are composited together in the render output.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Independent wall-clock time** | Each background layer tracks elapsed time independently using `performance.now()`, not the global playhead |
| **Automatic looping** | When a background composition reaches its end, it loops back to the start |
| **Media hydration** | Background layers load their own video, audio, and image elements independently |
| **Background audio** | Background layer audio is muted by default |
| **Layer deactivation** | Clicking an empty slot deactivates that layer; if it was the editor-active composition, the editor switches to the next active layer |

### Visual States

| State | Appearance |
|-------|------------|
| **Editor-active** | Highlighted slot (the composition currently open in the Timeline editor) |
| **Layer-active** | Secondary highlight for compositions playing on background layers |
| **Previewed** | Distinct highlight for the composition in preview mode |
| **Drag-over** | Drop target indicator when dragging a slot |
| **Empty** | Dim, unfilled slot |

## Tutorial System

Spotlight-based interactive tutorial that introduces new users to the interface. The tutorial uses a Clippy mascot companion and walks through panels and timeline elements with animated spotlight highlights.

### Automatic Launch

The tutorial starts automatically on first launch (when `hasSeenTutorial` is false). If a What's New changelog dialog is shown, the tutorial starts after it is closed. Once completed or skipped, it does not appear again unless manually triggered.

### Welcome Screen (Part 1 Start)

Before the tutorial steps begin, a centered welcome dialog asks the user about their editing background:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Premiere Pro** | Coming from Adobe Premiere Pro |
| **DaVinci Resolve** | Coming from DaVinci Resolve |
| **Final Cut Pro** | Coming from Final Cut Pro |
| **After Effects** | Coming from Adobe After Effects |
| **Beginner** | New to video editing |

The selection is saved to personalize the experience. A "Skip Tutorial" button is available to dismiss the entire tutorial immediately.

### Part 1 — Panel Introduction

After the welcome screen, the tutorial highlights each main panel one at a time using an SVG spotlight mask:

| Step | Panel | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Timeline** | Arrange and edit clips on tracks. Drag to move, trim edges, add keyframes and transitions. |
| 2 | **Preview** | Live preview of the composition. Play, pause, and scrub in real-time. |
| 3 | **Media** | Import and organize media files. Drag clips onto the Timeline to start editing. |
| 4 | **Properties** | Adjust transforms, effects, and masks for the selected clip. |

Each step:
- Dims the rest of the interface with a 75% opacity dark overlay
- Cuts out the highlighted panel with a rounded rectangle mask
- Activates the corresponding panel tab so it is visible
- Shows a tooltip with step number, title, description, and progress dots
- Advances on click anywhere

### Part 2 — Timeline Deep-Dive

Part 2 starts automatically after Part 1 finishes (unless Part 2 was already seen). It zooms into individual Timeline elements with a yellow highlight ring:

| Step | Element | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Playback** | Play, Stop, and Loop controls |
| 2 | **Timecode** | Current position and total duration display (click duration to edit) |
| 3 | **Tools & Zoom** | Snapping, Cut tool, Zoom, and Fit controls |
| 4 | **In/Out Points** | Set In (I) and Out (O) points for the export range |
| 5 | **Tracks** | Add video, audio, or text tracks |
| 6 | **Navigator** | Scroll and zoom the Timeline; drag edges to zoom in/out |

Part 2 highlights individual UI elements within the Timeline panel using CSS selectors. The Timeline panel itself remains fully visible (spotlight mask), while the target element gets a yellow highlight ring overlay.

### Clippy Mascot

An animated Clippy companion appears alongside tutorial tooltips:

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Intro** | One-shot WebM animation when the tutorial first opens |
| **Loop** | Continuous looping idle animation during tutorial steps |
| **Outro** | Exit animation when the tutorial is closed or skipped |

Falls back to a static WebP image if WebM video is not supported by the browser.

### Navigation and Controls

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Click anywhere** | Advance to the next step |
| **Escape** | Close the tutorial |
| **Skip button** | Available on every step and the welcome screen; plays the Clippy outro animation, then dismisses |
| **Progress dots** | Visual indicator showing current step and completed steps |

### Re-triggering Tutorials

Both tutorial parts can be re-launched manually from the menu bar:

| Menu Location | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Info menu → Tutorial | Start Part 1 (panel introduction) |
| Info menu → Timeline Tutorial | Start Part 2 (timeline deep-dive) |

## Resolution Settings

### Output Resolution
View menu → Resolution:
| Preset | Dimensions |
|--------|------------|
| 1080p | 1920×1080 |
| 720p | 1280×720 |
| 4K | 3840×2160 |
| 16:10 | 1920×1200 |
| 4:3 | 1024×768 |

### Preview Quality
View menu → Preview Quality:
| Option | Render Size | Performance |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Full (100%)** | 1920×1080 | Best quality |
| **Half (50%)** | 960×540 | 4× faster, 75% less memory |
| **Quarter (25%)** | 480×270 | 16× faster, 94% less memory |

Preview Quality scales the internal render resolution while maintaining the output aspect ratio. Lower quality settings significantly reduce GPU workload and memory usage—ideal for complex compositions or slower hardware.

**Memory Savings at Half Resolution:**
- Ping-pong buffers: 75% reduction
- RAM Preview cache: 75% reduction (7.2GB → 1.8GB)
- Scrubbing cache: 75% reduction

### Setting Resolution
```typescript
setResolution(width, height)
setPreviewQuality(quality) // 1, 0.5, or 0.25
```

## What Makes This Different

Most browser-based video editors, especially AI-generated ones, share a pattern: Canvas 2D compositing, heavyweight dependency trees, and CPU-bound rendering that falls apart at scale. This project takes a fundamentally different approach.

**GPU-first architecture.** Preview, scrubbing, and export all run through the same **WebGPU ping-pong compositor**. Video textures are imported as `texture_external` (**zero-copy**, no CPU roundtrip). **37 blend modes**, 3D rotation, and inline color effects all execute in a **single WGSL composite shader** per layer. No THREE.js, no GSAP, no Canvas 2D fallback in the hot path.

**Zero-copy export pipeline.** Frames are captured as `new VideoFrame(offscreenCanvas)` directly from the GPU canvas. **No `readPixels()`**, no `getImageData()`, no staging buffers in the default path. The GPU renders, **WebCodecs encodes**. That's it.

**3-tier scrubbing cache.** **300 GPU textures in VRAM** for instant scrub (Tier 1), per-video last-frame cache for seek transitions (Tier 2), and a **900-frame RAM Preview** with CPU/GPU promotion (Tier 3). When the cache is warm, **scrubbing doesn't decode at all**.

**13 production dependencies.** React, Zustand, FFmpeg WASM, mp4box, mp4/webm muxers, HuggingFace Transformers, ONNX Runtime, SoundTouch, WebGPU types. **Everything else is custom-built from scratch**: the entire WebGPU compositor, all 30+ effect shaders, the keyframe animation system, the export engine, the audio mixer, the text renderer, the mask engine, the video scope renderers, the dock/panel system, the timeline UI. Zero runtime abstraction layers between your timeline and the GPU.

**Nested composition rendering.** Compositions within compositions, each with their own resolution. Rendered to **pooled GPU textures** with frame-level caching, composited in the parent's ping-pong pass, all in a **single `device.queue.submit()`**.

## Why I Built This

No Adobe subscription, no patience for cracks, and every free online editor felt like garbage. I needed something that actually works - fast, in the browser, with the power of After Effects, Premiere, and a bit of Ableton mixed in.

**The vision:** A tool where AI can control *everything*. 50+ editing tools accessible via GPT. Plus a live video output for VJ performances (been doing video art for 16 years, so yeah, that matters to me).

**The reality:** ~75 hours of coding in, and I'm mass-producing features faster than I can stabilize them. Things break. A lot. But when it works, it *works*.

Built with Claude as my pair-programmer. I'm not mass-prompting generic code - every feature gets debugged, refactored, and beaten into shape until it does what I need.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

**Requirements:** Chrome 113+ with WebGPU support. Dedicated GPU recommended.

> **Linux:** Enable Vulkan for smooth 60fps: `chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan`

## Known Issues

This is alpha software. Features get added fast, things break.

- YouTube download requires Native Helper with yt-dlp installed
- Audio waveforms may not display for some video formats
- Very long videos (>2 hours) may cause performance issues

If something breaks, refresh. If it's still broken, [open an issue](https://github.com/Sportinger/MASterSelects/issues).
